# Customer Care
Using nodeJs modules to retrieve data and edit the sql database 

## Basic Functions involved are:
1. Creating a unique id for each call
2. Fetching available agents (depending on which agent is free) 
3. Changing the agent status (changing the status to busy if the agent is on call) 
4. Updating the call status
